FILE PATH
A file path describes the location of a file in a web site's folder structure. File paths are used when linking to external files, like: Web pages. Images. Style sheets.	`
On Windows, paths are written using backslashes ( \ ) as the separator between folder names. On Unix based operating system such as macOS, Linux, and BSDs, the forward slash ( / ) is used as the path separator.
A path is a string of characters used to uniquely identify a location in a directory structure. It is composed by following the directory tree hierarchy in which components, separated by a delimiting character, represent each directory. The delimiting character is most commonly the slash ("/"), the backslash character ("\"), or colon (":"), though some operating systems may use a different delimiter. Paths are used extensively in computer science to represent the directory/file relationships common in modern operating systems and are essential in the construction of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). Resources can be represented by either absolute or relative paths.
Programming languages also use paths. E.g.: When a file is opened. Most programming languages use the path representation of the underlying operating system:

 uxFile = fopen("project/readme.txt", "r")
 winFile = fopen("C:\\Program Files\\bin\\config.bat", "r")
This direct access to the operating system paths can hinder the portability of programs. To support portable programs Java uses File.separator to distinguish between / and \ separated paths. Seed7 has a different approach for the path representation. In Seed7 all paths use the Unix path convention, independent of the operating system. Under windows a mapping takes place (e.g.: The path /c/users is mapped to c:\users).
In general, a path is a string of characters which specifies a unique location in a directory or page hierarchy. For file systems, each level in the hierarchy is a directory. For URLs, each level in the hierarchy is a page. Different sections of the path are separated by a path separator, such as a forward slash (/). These different sections represent the separate directories or pages in the hierarchy, as shown below:

/home/user/python/test.py

In this file path, the test.py file is inside the python directory. The python directory is a subdirectory of the user directory, which is a subdirectory of the home directory. File paths are one example of a path. Paths are also an important component of URLs.
